"The sole exceptions are the cool breeze on the river, 
the bright moon over the hills. 
These serve as music to our ears, 
as colour to our eyes; 
these we can take freely and enjoy forever; 
these are inexhaustible treasures supplied by the Creator, 
and things in which we can delight together."

Su Shi, *First Visit to the Red Cliff*, 1082 C.E.
