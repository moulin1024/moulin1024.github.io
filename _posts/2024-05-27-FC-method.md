## Frieman-Chen's derivation of Non-linear Vlasov Equation

### Motivation
1. **Electromagnetic Instabilities**:
   - Important in transport processes of magnetically confined plasmas.
   - Frequencies lower than the ion cyclotron frequency.
   - Perpendicular to the magnetic field and wavelengths close to the ion Larmor radius.

2. **Complex Sensitivity**:
   - These instabilities are sensitive to magnetic field configurations (e.g., magnetic shear, gradients, curvature drifts, and trapped particles).

3. **Gyrokinetics Development**:
   - Methods developed by Rutherford and Frieman, and Taylor and Hastie to handle the linear aspects of drift waves in general magnetic configurations.
   - Extended to include electromagnetic fluctuations related to shear and compressional Alfv√©n waves.

4. **Nonlinear Processes**:
   - Transport caused by instabilities is determined by nonlinear processes.
   - The motivation is to extend the gyrokinetic formalism to the nonlinear regime while retaining key features like finite Larmor radius and arbitrary magnetic configurations.

5. **Multi-scale Expansion**:
   - Developed a nonlinear gyrokinetic formalism based on multi-scale expansion.
   - Microscopic fluctuations vary on a fast (linear) timescale, while macroscopic quantities change on a slower transport timescale.
   - Cyclotron frequency is the fastest timescale.

6. **Nonlinear Time Scale**:
   - Nonlinear timescale allowed to be comparable to the linear timescale.
   - Results applicable in strong turbulence regions.
